# Required Software

To participate in the SIMD/MMX/SSE/AVX labs, you will need:
- A C/C++ compiler
- A code editor (some IDEs already include a compiler)
- The OpenCV library (used to display images in exercises 3&4)

The instructions below will help you install and configure these tools.

## Preliminary note

Last year, when everybody could work on the machines provided by TSE,
everybody used Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2015 to do the labs, as
these software are pre-installed.

This year, because of the COVID-19 crisis, we are all at home, some
with very bad internet connexion, others with bad computers.

Unfortunately, to install Visual Studio, you need:
- A large band connexion (VS2019 requires downloading ~20GB!)
- A stable connexion (VS2019's installer does not know how to recover
  from network interruptions and re-downloads most packages when this
  occurs, thus the installation is endless with a bad network)
- A well equiped computer (VS2019 requires at least 2GB RAM...)
- Windows (i.e. at least additional 4GB RAM...)

As a consequence, I have adapted the labs and they now can be done
under Windows or Linux with very lightweight software (~200MB).

I have personally resolved the labs under the following environments:
- Text Editor + Manual compilation
- **Code::Blocks**
- VSCode + C/C++ Extension
- Visual Studio 2019 (Windows Only)

**For this year, I'll ask you as much as possible to use Code::Blocks, as it will **

You'll find below instructions to install these software.
