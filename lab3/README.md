# New hardware for HPP

## Lab Objectives

HPP is an ever evolving topic, and many approaches at the frontier of this course exist. The Lab#3 is dedicated to let you discover trending or established technologies, framework, tools of the utmost practical interest for HPP that we could not practice in the other lab -- we can't implement all HPP technologies in such a short time! However, it is also interesting to have basic knowledge about such approaches. Topics can also includes how famous security breaches were created using techniques we have seen in the Lab#1 & Lab#2.

As a consequence, Lab#3 is made for you to dive into *one* of these technology/framework/tool, understand what it does and what it does not, what are its limitations, and then *share your knowledge with your peers*.


## Topics

The sessions on the 15th April and 5th May are made for you to research and understand your assigned topic as a group.

The session on the 7th of May is made for you to present your assigned topic to the rest of the class.
To this end, you will provide a slide deck for an oral presentation of 15 minutes.

While you are free to propose your own agenda for these presentations, you must provide the following information to the audience for your assigned topic:
- Why someone invented this technology/framework/software/concept works (motivations)?
- How does the technology/framework/software/concept works?
- Is it recent/contemporary/future technology/framework/software/concept works?
- What are the pros/cons?
- How much does it costs? (in hardware price tags, development time, ...)
- Provide illustrative tasks where that technology excels and report what can be the gain in such settings (in the best situation, for which it has been designed, what can be gained?)

We expect (and evaluated oral presentations accordingly):
- Original content
- Everyone to equally participate to the presentation
- Engaging and clear presentations
- Quality of give-away messages (what you peers are to learn from your presentations ?)
- A lively discussion: you are expected to ask questions at the end of your peers' presentations!


## Assignments

| Group number  | Assigned topic | List of students |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1  | ?   | A / B / C    |

(To be completed on the 15th of April together as an optimization problem to satisfy your wishes to investigate on a topic, but also covering all topics for the classroom).
